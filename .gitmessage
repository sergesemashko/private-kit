# This template is for commits to this repo.  Change the first line (think of
# it as the "headline" for the commit) and then add a longer description of
# the change.  To be nice, keep the headline to 50 characters (Github will
# truncate after that in its UI) and wrap content at 78 characters
# or less (to be nice in all text editors).  The first lines of this template
# are exactly 50 and 78 characters for reference.
#
# Also use imperative writing in the headline and description, such as "Fix
# broken code" not "Fixes the broken code" or "Fixed the broken code".  Good
# imperative phrases are:
#   * Add something new
#   * Fix something broken
#   * Remove unused something
#   * Update this thing
#   * Refactor that thing
# As you see above, you can use [Github markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
# freely. Notice the above violation of the 78 character rule in the long
# hyperlink -- just don't include important stuff after the 78th character,
# wrap as soon as possible.
#
# Finally, you can include nice code examples like this:
# ```python
# def example():
#     print("Nicely highlighted python code")
# ```
#
# Sections below can be filled out and edited as appropriate. The same
# sections are used in the PR template, so this can be notes to yourself for
# when you check in a larger body of work with multiple commits.  Sections
# can optionally be removed.
#
# Please fill this out carefully. This moment is when the code you are
# committing is clearest in the mind of you, the foremost expert in this
# change. Please pause to think of side effects and impacts.
